// Map vs. For Loop Practice

// Below are exercises to get you seeing the differences between using a map and a for loop. Beneath each prompt write the code fo fulfill the exercise requirement.


// Exercise 1
// Consider this variable:
var nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
// Write a for loop that saves the result of each number multiplied by 5 to another array.

// Exercise 2
// Use a map on the nums array that saves the result of each number multiplied by 5 to another array.

// Exercise 3
// Consider this variable:
var numbers = [11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66]
// Write a for loop that saves all numbers in the numbers array that are evenly divisible by 3 into another array.

// Exercise 4
// Use map on the numbers array to save any numbers from the array that are evenly divisible by 3 into another array.

// Exercise 5
// Consider this variable:
var toons = [{name: "Tom", animal: "cat"}, {name: "Jerry", animal: "mouse"}, {name: "Bugs", animal: "rabbit"}, {name: "Daffy", animal: "duck"}, {name: "Felix", animal: "cat"}, {name: "Oswald", animal: "rabbit"}]
// Write a for loop that saves all cat characters to another array.

// Exercise 6
// Use map on the toons array to save all rabbit characters to another array.

// Exercise 7
// Write a for loop to save the names of each character to another array.

// Exercise 8
// Use map on the toons array to save a description of each character to another array.

// Exercise 9
// Consider this variable:
var people = [{firstName: "Alan", lastName: "Grant"}, {firstName: "Ellie", lastName: "Sattler"}, {firstName: "Ian", lastName: "Malcolm"}]
// Write a for loop that creates a new object for every person that has a key value for firstName, lastName, and fullName and saves each new object into another array.

// Exercise 10
// Refactor the above code to use a map on the people array to achieve the same result.

// Exercise 11
// Consider this function:
function addTitle(person){
  return "Dr. " + person.firstName + " " + person.lastName
}
// Write a for loop that iterates through each person in the people array and stores the result of addTitle on each element to another array.

// Exercise 12
// Use map on the run addTitle on each element in the people array and store the result of each call into another array.
