// Array Methods Practice

 // Below are exercises in using array methods. Beneath each prompt write the code to fulfill the exercise requirement.

 // Exercise 1
 // Consider this variable:
 var groceryList1 = ["apples", "carrots", "oatmeal"]
 // Write the code that will add "granola" to the end of array without altering the original array.

 // Exercise 2
 // Consider this variable:
 var groceryList2 = ["chips", "dip", "cookies"]
 // Write the code that will add "soda" to the end of the original array.

 // Exercise 3
 // Consider this variable:
 var numbers1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
 // Write the code that will add the number 0 to the beginning of the array without altering the original array.

 // Exercise 4
 // Consider this variable:
 var numbers2 = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
 // Write the code that will add the number 0 to the beginning of the original array.

 // Exercise 5
 // Consider this variable:
 var numbers3 = [2, 13, 6, 8, 4, 2]
 // Write the code that finds the index of the first appearance of the number 2.

 // Exercise 6
 // Write the code that finds the index of the last appearance of the number 2.

 // Exercise 7
 // Consider this variable:
 var chars = ["y", "a", "r", "r", "a"]
 // Write the code that brings all the letters in the chars array together into a string.

 // Exercise 8
 // Write the code that reverses the order of the letters in the chars array and saves it into a variable called charsReversed.

 // Exercise 9
 // Write the code that brings all the letters in the charsReversed array together into a string with a hyphen between each letter.

 // Exercise 10
 // Write the code that brings all the letters in the charsReversed Array together into a string without separators.
